## About The Project

The Velvety System is an online management system that simplifies communication and approval processes between employees and managers. The system enables employees to submit requests, such as leave or party requests, automatically forwarded to their respective managers for review and approval. Managers can use the system to approve or decline requests easily. The interface of the Velvety System is user-friendly, allowing employees to submit requests promptly and managers to review them efficiently. The system was developed using PHP as the backend language.
